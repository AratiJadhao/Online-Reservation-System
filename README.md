# Online-Reservation-System
In this example, we have created a simple reservation system for booking hotel rooms. 
Users can select a room type and check its availability for a given date.
Creating a complete online reservation system in Java involves several components, including user authentication, booking management, database integration, and more.
For this example, we have used a basic in-memory data structure to store room and booking information. 
In a real-world scenario, you'd use a database for persistent data storage.
